# Group By sort
In this section, we implement the group by sorting which consists of first sorting data, then aggregate it. This approach help to identify easily the groups since they are repeated in same blocks, we choose to perform 3 sorting algorithms, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Heap Sort, we gather all java classes into one main classe that contains the user interface.
The user can choose at first the CSV file, secondly the column name that contains groups and finally choose the implementation mode, the results are written in a CSV file
